对象和数组

- To access an array member you use $array['KEY'];
- To access an object member you use $obj->KEY;
- To access an object member inside an array of objects:
  - $array[0] // Get the first object in the array
  - $array[0]->KEY // then access its key
- You may also loop over an array of objects like so:
  ```php
  foreach ($arrayOfObjs as $key => $object) {
  	echo $object->object_property;
  }
  ```
