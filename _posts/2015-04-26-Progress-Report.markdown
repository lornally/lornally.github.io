**SUBJECT**: Progress Report on my Academic Career at BUAA

**Work Completed**

Things are coming along very well in regards to my time here at BUAA.
First of all, I think I did a good job at my study. At each semester, although I was not top among students but always was the first 30% of them. That’s a far better grade than the goal I set to myself before entering the university.

In the aspect of my social work, I was the monitor of my class from freshman to sophomore year. During my time as a monitor, I experienced and learned a lot from this share of responsibility. Whether solving the problems among classmates or informing our student counselor of concrete student’s life, I kept thinking, studying and practicing, and tried my best to do these things well.

As an engineering student, I participated in several competitions in the past three years. Feng Ru Cup is the official annual scientific and technological competition in BUAA and I took part in it at sophomore year. Unfortunately, I did not win any reward for my project. However, I gained much competition experience from it. In addition to Feng Ru Cup, early in my sophomore, I joined in an algorithm competition which is ACM/ICPC regional in Nanjing and Hangzhou, and won two silver medals.

I love playing table tennis, so I still represented our software college to participate in table tennis matches in freshman and sophomore years. Both of the two matches our team fell down in front of the top four.

University life without being a member of a student club is incomplete. I enrolled in a club called AIESEC when I was a freshman. AIESEC is an international non-profit organization totally managed by students whose vision is “Peace and fulfillment of Humankind's potential”. It’s really cool to touch various kinds of people around the world and strive for a same purpose.

Last but not least experience in my university life, is that I did a voluntary work at Sunshine Village orphanage in the winter of my sophomore year. It is quite a unforgettable experience. I rethought about the significant of family, love, fate and equality after I finished the voluntary work.

Overall, I’m satisfied with my experience since I entered the BUAA.

**Work Scheduled/Planned**

I still have several things that must be done before I am able to graduate.
The most important thing to do is my graduation project. After a four-year study at my major in BUAA, the best thing to check my learning outcomes is a perfect graduation project. I think it’s my next year’s focus.

Meanwhile, I plan to apply for an internship later this year. As we all know, lore from books needs to be practiced in real production environment.

Keep going!
