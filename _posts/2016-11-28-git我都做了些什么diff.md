> 这个文档, 我们要解决每次add, commit, push的时候, 我们究竟提交了啥的问题.

### 目标

1. 每次commit提交之前, 查看git的修改有哪些.
2. 每次add之前, 查看git的修改有哪些.
3. 每次push之前, 查看git的修改有哪些.

### 竟然都是diff

1. 目前暂存中的修改：git diff --staged

2. 尚未缓存的改动：git diff    缩写: gd

3. 查看已缓存的改动： git diff —cached  缩写: gdca

4. 查看已缓存的与未缓存的所有改动：git diff HEAD

5. 显示摘要而非整个 gds：git diff --stat

6. gdt git diff-tree --no-commit-id --name-only -r

7. gdw git diff --word-diff

8. 最后两次提交的差异git diff HEAD^ HEAD

9. ```sh
   git diff HEAD^..HEAD
   git diff HEAD^..
   git diff HEAD^ HEAD
   git diff HEAD~15       # diff the working tree with the 15th previous commit
   git diff HEAD~15 HEAD  # diff the last commit  with the 15th previous commit
   git diff HEAD~N
   git diff HEAD~N..
   gd HEAD~2 # 这个最简洁.
   git diff @~..@
   git show
   gsps #git show --pretty=short --show-signature
   git diff @^
   git diff HEAD^
   git diff commit_id
   #这里面 ~=^, @=HEAD
   gd @^
   gd @~ #这两个都是可以的. 
   ```
