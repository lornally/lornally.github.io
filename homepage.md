## Summary of Recent Work
- **Vaidya Black Hole in f(R) Gravity** <!-- ([click to see the summary]({{ site.url }}/assets/hjp/Summary_Vaidya-Black-Hole-in-fR-Gravity.pdf)) -->
	- We try to get the solution of Vaidya Black Hole in f(R) gravity and investiaget its thermodynamics properties. But, since it's very hard to obtain the solutions directly, we use another method to calculate the thermodynamics directly.
	
- **Possible Connection Between Entropy Production and Uniqueness of Solutions** <!-- ([click to see the summary]({{ site.url }}/assets/hjp/Summary_Source-of-Entropy.pdf)) -->
	- Frist, we try to explain the entropy production term by considering the black hole as a model somehow like a water drop but failed. Then, I accidently find a possible connection between entropy production term and uniqueness of black hole solutions in a spacetime, which leads further to a clue that we can possibly distinguish the two forms of general spheric metric, althought they can be transmitted to each other by coordinate transformations.
- **Neutron Stars** (this is a group work, summary not available)
	- We try to build a new model of neutron stars since Chandrasekhar Limit is found to be silghtly violated. This could be a chance to inveastigate the real process of nuclear action within a neutron stars and also the validity of alternative gravity  in larger scalar.

## Recommandation Letters

##### Note: one need to contact with the professors directly to get the RLs
- Dr. Ya-peng Hu, Associate Professor <huyp@nuaa.edu.cn>
	- my principal advisor in General Theory of Relativity and Cosmology
- Dr. Xiao-tao He, Associate Professor <hext@nuaa.edu.cn>
	- we work on the topic neutron stars to investigate the problem that Chandrasekhar Limit is slightly violated
